Build Demo 2025
This is a sample project demonstrating a slightly more complex scenario with external dependencies and a data processing bug.

The project fetches a list of numbers from a URL, processes the data, and calculates a sum.

Files
README.md: This file.

main.py: The main Python script containing the data fetching and processing logic with a bug.

requirements.txt: Lists project dependencies.

Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd sample-buggy-project

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the main script:

python main.py

(Note: The script is currently hardcoded to fetch from a specific dummy URL. In a real scenario, this might be configurable.)
