# Tic Tac Toe Game - Build Demo 2025

This repository contains a simplified example of a common bug encountered in asynchronous programming, specifically related to state management and resource handling during error conditions. It serves as a demonstration of how such a bug might manifest and how it can be documented and fixed, similar to a real-world workflow using GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

**Disclaimer:** This code is a minimal, illustrative example and not intended for production use. The simulated external service and task processing are simplified to highlight the specific bug.

## Repository
https://github.com/Bruce-Moe/build-demo-2025

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

1.  A potential logical bug in an asynchronous Python application involving state inconsistency after an error.
2.  How this bug can lead to unexpected behavior (a worker becoming unresponsive).
3.  How such an issue might be reported in a platform like GitHub Issues.
4.  How the fix addresses the root cause of the bug.

## Files

* `README.md`: This file.

* `main.py`: The main Python script containing the game logic.

* `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone 


   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Build-Demo-2025


   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


   ```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py


```

*(Note: The script is currently hardcoded to fetch from a specific dummy URL. In a real scenario, this might be configurable.)*

## Contributing
